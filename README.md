### squirrelMapperObservations.csv

Dataset includes 60,262 observations through December 21, 2021 of eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) contributed to SquirrelMapper (http://squirrelmapper.org/) and classified to color morph via Zooniverse by at least 10 people. The file includes six variables:

database: "original squirrelMapper" (observations contributed without photographs until 2019) and "iNaturalist" (observations contributed to the SquirrelMapper project via iNaturalist with photographs and classified as reserach grade.

inat.id:  iNaturalist identification code for all iNaturalist observations.

date:  date of observation

latitude:  latitude of observation

longitude:  longitude of observation

morph.class:  "gray", "melanic", or "other". Each row represents the observation of at least one individual of the given morph at the given time and location. "original squirrelMapper" observations were contributed directly by observers without photographs.  "iNaturalist" observations were classified for color morph by at least 10 people on Zooniverse, and a final classification was retained for this dataset if there was at least 80% agreement among classifications. 

### squirrelObservationMaps

Maps of a thinned set of eastern gray squirrel observations form squirrelMapperObservations.csv to 43 cities in the native range of S. carolinensis in North America and a minimum of 10 m separating each observation.
